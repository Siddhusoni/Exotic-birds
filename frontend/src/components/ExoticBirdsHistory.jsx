                    In the 18th and 19th centuries, the fascination with exotic birds grew as explorers from Europe traveled to remote regions, bringing back specimens of these rare and vibrant creatures. Parrots, cockatoos, and other species quickly became popular as pets among the wealthy, symbolizing status and luxury. Over time, efforts have been made to protect these birds and their natural habitats from the threats of overhunting and habitat destruction.
